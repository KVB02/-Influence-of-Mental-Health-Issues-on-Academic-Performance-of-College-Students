# Influence-of-Mental-Health-Issues-on-Academic-Performance-of-College-Students


# Project Description

This research investigates the influence of mental health on the academic performance of college students. Utilizing R, the study conducts extensive data analysis and statistical modeling to explore the correlation between mental health scores and GPA, providing insights into how mental health affects educational outcomes.


# Technologies and Libraries Used

R: Primary language for statistical analysis and data manipulation.

ggplot2: For creating sophisticated visualizations and histograms.

dplyr: Facilitates data manipulation and cleaning.

car: Provides advanced regression diagnostic plots.

stats: Used for conducting correlation analysis, T-tests, Shapiro-Wilk tests, and regression analysis.

readxl: For reading data from Excel files.

tidyr: Assists in data tidying for analysis.

ANOVA: Utilized for performing Analysis of Variance tests, exploring differences in mental health scores across different groups.


# Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine to get started with the analysis: 

git clone https://github.com/KVB02/Influence-of-Mental-Health-Impact-on-Academic-Performance.git
